I have used 2 brokers for option selling. I will update here if I add more. 
**Zerodha** is a class apart in terms of usability and speed. Basket orders are an 
incredible value addition as it shows margin upfront. Sensibull linked to
Zerodha makes life easy for any option seller. Only drawback being Zerodha doesn't 
allow far otm buying for weekly expiries. This means you can only do a 
naked sell and nothedge your positions. Brokerage is **20** per trade

**SasOnline** is another discount broker I have tried for options selling. 
They offer **1 month of free brokerage** trades and **9** per trade. Drawbacks include 
no sync and viewing of positions over the weekend. They do allow deep otm buys and sells
for weekly expiries.

I plan to trade further In **Paytm, Groww** in the future, will update the experience here
once I do trade in them
